# Removing views from a UIStackView with removeArrangedSubview()

That was a long chapter, and I hope you learned a lot. But you deserve a break, so I have some good news: it's trivial to remove views from a UIStackView. Heck, at its simplest it's just a matter of telling `removeArrangedSubview()` which view you don’t want then removing that view from its superview – the others are automatically resized and re-arranged to fill the space.

However, using `removeArrangedSubview()` *doesn’t* remove the view altogether – it keeps the view in memory, which is helpful if you plan to re-add it later on because you can avoid recreating it. Here, though, we actually want to remove the web view and destroy it entirely, and that can be done with a call to `removeFromSuperview()` instead.

In this particular project, we need to do a little more:

- We want the delete button to work only if there's a web view selected.
- We want to find the location of the active web view inside the stack view, then remove it.
- If there are now no more web views, we want to call `setDefaultTitle()` to reset the user interface.
- We need to find whatever web view immediately follows the one that was removed.
- We then make that the new selected web view, highlighting it in blue.

We already pointed the delete button at a method called `deleteWebView()`, so all you need to do is plug this in. I've added comments to make sure it's all clear:

    @objc func deleteWebView() {
        // safely unwrap our webview
        if let webView = activeWebView {
            if let index = stackView.arrangedSubviews.firstIndex(of: webView) {
                // We found the webview – remove it from the stack view and destroy it
                webView.removeFromSuperview()

                if stackView.arrangedSubviews.count == 0 {
                    // go back to our default UI
                    setDefaultTitle()
                } else {
                    // convert the Index value into an integer
                    var currentIndex = Int(index)

                    // if that was the last web view in the stack, go back one
                    if currentIndex == stackView.arrangedSubviews.count {
                        currentIndex = stackView.arrangedSubviews.count - 1
                    }

                    // find the web view at the new index and select it
                    if let newSelectedWebView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[currentIndex] as? WKWebView {
                        selectWebView(newSelectedWebView)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

So, although the act of removing a view from a `UIStackView` is just a matter of calling either `removeArrangedSubview()` or `removeFromSuperview()` depending on whether you want to use it again, we need to do a little more to make sure the user interface updates correctly.

The last thing we're going to do is talk about multitasking on iPad, and add a few user interface clean ups to make the project complete…
